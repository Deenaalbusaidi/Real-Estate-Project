    "# **Real Estate Data Collection and Cleaning Project**\n",
    "## **Important Notes (Read Carefully)**\n",
    " * **Individual Project** – This is strictly an individual assignment. Collaboration is not allowed.\n",
    " * **Internet Use** – You may search for concepts or documentation online. However, copying code directly from external sources is prohibited.\n",
    " * **Evaluation Format** – You will participate in a one-on-one review, where you must explain your process, decisions, and code functionality.\n",
    " * **Timeline:**\n",
    "   1. Start: Wednesday morning\n",
    "   2. Deadline: End of day Thursday\n",
    "* **Early Submission** – If you complete and push your project to GitHub early, you are free to leave the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Objective**\n",
    "* This project is designed to simulate a real-world data science task. You will scrape property data from two real estate websites, clean and integrate the data, engineer features, and frame a predictive modeling challenge based on pricing.\n",
    "* The final deliverable will be a GitHub repository containing all project artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Assigned Websites**\n",
    "* You will be assigned two real estate websites. Each site contains listings for properties for rent and properties for sale.\n",
    "  1. Website 1: https://www.bayut.om/en/\n",
    "  2. Website 2: https://hilalprp.com.om/\n",
    "* Your task is to collect data relevant to the pricing and characteristics of listed properties for rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Requirements**\n",
    "1. **Web Scraping**\n",
    "   * Scrape relevant data (e.g., property title, location, number of rooms, price, size, listing type).\n",
    "   * Save the raw data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).\n",
    "   * Handle pagination and dynamic content if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning & Integration**\n",
    "   * Use Python functions to clean the data (missing values, inconsistent formatting, duplicates, etc.).\n",
    "   * Combine data from both websites into a single cleaned CSV file.\n",
    "   * Ensure consistency in column naming and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   * Generate new features to support later modeling (e.g., price per square meter, total rooms, encoded categorical values).\n",
    "   * Apply appropriate feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Predictive Modeling (Challenge)**\n",
    "   * Define a modeling objective, such as predicting property price.\n",
    "   * Prepare your dataset accordingly (split features/target, handle categorical variables, etc.).\n",
    "   * Suggest and briefly implement Scikit-learn models suitable for the task (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).\n",
    "   * This is a bonus challenge. It is not required but will earn additional credit if well-executed.\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. **GitHub Repository**\n",
    "* Each student must create a public GitHub repository with the following:\n",
    "  * Web scraping scripts or notebooks\n",
    "  * Data cleaning functions\n",
    "  * Final combined CSV file\n",
    "  * Feature engineering and modeling code\n",
    "  * A brief README.md file explaining:\n",
    "    * Your objectives\n",
    "    * Websites used\n",
    "    * Steps taken in data collection and cleaning\n",
    "    * Feature engineering strategy\n",
    "    * Modeling approach (if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Deliverables Summary**\n",
    "* Raw scraped data(CSV or JSON).\n",
    "* Cleaning code(.py script or notebook)\n",
    "* Final cleaned & combined dataset(CSV)\n",
    "* Feature engineering & scaling(Notebook or script)\n",
    "* (Optional) Modeling code(Notebook or script)\n",
    "* GitHub repository with all files(Public URL)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Evaluation Criteria**\n",
    "* Web Scraping(40%)\n",
    "* Data Cleaning & Integration(30%)\n",
    "* Feature Engineering(20%)\n",
    "* Code Quality & GitHub Setup(10%)\n",
    "* Challenge Task (Modeling)(+15% Bonus)\n",
    "* The bonus challenge will not affect your core score but can significantly boost your final evaluation if completed thoughtfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Reminders\n",
    "* Structure your code professionally and document your functions.\n",
    "* Keep your GitHub repo clean and organized.\n",
    "* Be prepared to explain your choices in the evaluation interview.\n"
